    NAME
    ====
    B{C{r.PathConflicts()}} - Raises errors when paths conflict

    SYNOPSIS
    ========
    C{r.PathConflicts(exceptions='/path/regexp/.*')}
    C{r.PathConflicts(exceptions=['/regexp/.*', '/other/foo.*'])}
    C{r.PathConflicts(exceptions=r.troveFilter('foo:runtime'))}
    C{foo = r.troveFilter('foo:runtime')}
    C{bar = r.troveFilter('bar:runtime')}
    C{r.PathConflicts(exceptions=[foo, bar])}

    DESCRIPTION
    ===========
    Raises a GroupPathConflict error describing path conflicts,
    except for path conflicts specifically provided as exceptions.

    Exceptions may be provided either by regular expressions matched
    against paths, or as C{troveFilter}s matched against the troves
    containing the paths.

    Paths removed from conflict handling are not reported in any
    errors.

    If two troves conflict, and only one of the troves has been
    listed as an exception, no path conflict error is raised.  A
    path conflict error is raised only if there is more than one
    trove that is B{not} listed as an exception to this C{PathConflicts}
    policy.
