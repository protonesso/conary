Filters are slightly extended regular expressions with mode bit masking.
The extended regular expressions are applied to filenames, and the
mode bit masks (positive and negative) are applied to the mode of the
file as it appears in the filesystem.

    strings in a set of matches rather than compiling a regular
    expression.  This is used when the matches are generated from
    specific files in the filesystem, and is not made directly
    available in recipes.  It will be generally faster than using
    a regular expression, and some versions of python are built
    with limitations on the complexity of regular expressions that
    raise OverflowError for regular expressions of complexity seen
    in real packages.
