Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

Bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

Included in the bash package is the Programmable Completion Code, by
